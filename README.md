# Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist

## Overview
This project analyzes the **Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist** to derive insights, build predictive models, and deploy a machine learning solution. The workflow includes data analysis, feature engineering, model building, evaluation, and deployment.

## Dataset
The dataset contains transactions from **Olist**, a Brazilian e-commerce platform, covering orders, customer details, product information, payments, and reviews.

## Project Workflow
The project is structured into multiple phases:

| Task | Documents Needed | Time | Target Date | Done Date | Status |

| **Data Analysis** | Code, PPT | 2 days | 03/20/2025 | ✅ Completed | ✅ Done |
| **Feature Extraction / Creation** | Standard Scripts | 1 day | 03/21/2025 | ✅ Completed | ✅ Done |
| **Model Building** | Scripts | 1 day | 03/22/2025 | - | 🔄 In Progress |
| **Model Comparison** | Model comparisons and detailed analysis | 2 days | 03/23/2025 | - | ⏳ Pending |
| **Deployment** | Flask API with basic UI | 1 day | 03/24/2025 | - | ⏳ Pending |
| **Final Presentation** | PPT, repo with all documentation | 1 day | 03/25/2025 | - | ⏳ Pending |

## Progress
- ✅ Completed **Data Analysis**
- ✅ Completed **Feature Extraction / Engineering**
